⭐ To install vite + react we need to follow the following stapes : 
    1: in cmd go to the folder ib which want to install and write :
            (a): npm create vite@latest
            
            (b): Project name : <give a project name> 
                                            note that the name of the project is the folder name is 
                                            which the vite application is created.
            (c): select a framework : 
                    > React
                 select a variant 
                    > JavaScript
        now the folder is created as the name of the <project name>            
    2: go the the project folder in cmd and write:
            (a): npm i
                wait
            (b): npm run dev
        now the default application of vite will run.

    
⭐ Now clean the files:
    App.css, index.css, App.jsx : and write rafce 
    Delete : assets folder



⭐ Now we see how react run 'Hello World' project :

(1): App.jsx 
        import React from 'react';
        export const App = () => {  
            return (
                <div>Hello world</div> 
            ) 
        }
        export default App;
    
    this App.jsx return a component(App) to main.jsx 
(2): main.jsx
        import { StrictMode } from 'react'
        import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
        import App from './App.jsx'

        createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
            <StrictMode>
                <App /> 
            </StrictMode>
        )
    this main.jsx send the jsx components inside <StrictMode> tag to the index.html <div> which id="root"
(3): index.html
        
    this can show the hole component as like html.
